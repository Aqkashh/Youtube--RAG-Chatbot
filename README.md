2. Splits transcripts into overlapping chunks for better context

3. Stores chunks in a Chroma vector database

4. Embeds user questions and performs similarity search

5. Sends context + question to an LLM (DeepSeek-R1-0528 or any Hugging Face model)

6. Supports local DB persistence and multi-video ingestion


Tech Stack

1. Python 3.10+
